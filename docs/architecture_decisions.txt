Frontend: The frontend will display person and location data. It will interface with the backend using RESTful API (location, persion, and connection services).

Location-event:
    Consume kafka messages from the location service and then generate fresh data for the location using the grpc protocol.

Location-service: 
    I chose gRPC and kafka to implement location endpoints because there is no need to communicate directly with the frontend and it can be called by tcp protocol, 
    and when using kafka support event driven it makes application low coupling and with gRPC protocal it makes application run faster. 
    2 Endpoints of gRPC will be used to implement this:
        - GetLocation: find location by id
        - CreateLocation: To create a new location, submit a new message to Kafka.
    
Connection-service: Displays the relationship between a person and a location.

Database: 
    All service data will be stored in the Postge database.
